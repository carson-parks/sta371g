    \fontsize{8}{8}\selectfont
      \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Previously, we assumed that the explanatory variables were either from a small set or chosen in advance.
        \item However, selecting the explanatory variables, or figuring out what predicts the number of physicians that a county has, is a large part of the analysis in this case.
        \item This type of analysis is an exploratory study.
      \end{itemize} 
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}[fragile]{An exploratory study of the Texas physician shortage}
      \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Exploratory studies are observational studies, in that the variables are observed rather than controlled, which is different from an experiment.
        \item Multicollinearity is much more likely in an exploratory study than in an experiment or a confirmatory study.
        \item Exploratory studies require the most in terms of model selection. Automated tools are helpful, but judgement is still needed!

    \begin{frame}[fragile]{Building all of the possible models}
    \fontsize{8}{8}\selectfont
      \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Previously, we built the full model and eliminated the variables in order of largest p-value (or smallest t-score). This is what the reading assignment calls backward stepwise regression.
        \item This method is not guaranteed to find to the best model!
        \item If there are n candidate predictor variables, there are $2^n$ possible models, and we need to look at ALL of them to be sure that we have found the best model.
        \item This is where R's automated model building tools help.
      \end{itemize} 
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}[fragile]{How to decide which model is best}
    \fontsize{8}{8}\selectfont
      \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item We have used $R^2$ and Adjusted-$R^2$ to select the best models
        \item But $R^2$ is not good for comparing models with differnet numbers of variables because it tends to increase a little bit with each additional variable just due to randomness.
        \item Adjusted-$R^2$ is better because it multiplies $R^2$ by a penalty that depends on the number of variables, but the penalty is somewhat arbitrary and increases as the number of variables increases.
      \end{itemize} 
    \end{frame}


    \begin{frame}[fragile]{There are many ways to decide which model is best}
    \fontsize{8}{8}\selectfont
      \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item All model measuring criteria try to find a balance between the predictive power of the model and the number of variables.
        \item No method is ideal in all situations, so it is generally best to use multiple methods and look at the results.
        \item AIC (Akaikeâ€™s Information Criterion) and the very similar BIC (your reading calls it SBC) are other widely used criterion that often gives different results than Adjusted-$R^2$.

    \begin{frame}[fragile]{Stepping forwards}
      \fontsize{8}{8}\selectfont
       The step() function uses the AIC criterion to compare models. You must build the null and the full models first.

      <<>>=

      null <- lm(PhysiciansPer10000~1, data=mcounties)

      full <- lm(PhysiciansPer10000 ~ LandArea + PctRural + MedianIncome
                                    + Population + PctUnder18 + PctOver65
                                    + PctPoverty + PctUninsured 
                                    + PctSomeCollege + PctUnemployed, 
                                    data=mcounties)

      stepforwardOut <- step(null, scope=list(lower=null, upper=full), 
                                   direction ="forward")

      @

      \lc 
    \end{frame}

  
    \begin{frame}[fragile]{Stepping backwards and both ways}
    \fontsize{8}{8}\selectfont
    You can also step backward or on both directions

      <<>>=

    
      stepbackwardOut<- step(null, scope=list(lower=null, upper=full), 
                        direction ="backward")

      stepboth.out <-   step(null, scope=list(lower=null, upper=full), 
                        direction ="both")

      @

      \lc
    \end{frame}


    \begin{frame}[fragile]{Check the LINE assumptions}
      \fontsize{8}{8}\selectfont
      <<echo=F>>=
      par(mfrow=c(2,2)) # change the panel layout to 2x2
      @
      <<fig.width=4.5>>=
      plot(stepbackwardOut)
      @
      <<echo=F>>=
      par(mfrow=c(1,1)) # change the panel layout back

    \end{frame}


    \begin{frame}[fragile]{Check for multicollinearity}
     This model looks pretty good, but is it the best that can be done?
    \fontsize{8}{8}\selectfont
     <<>>=

     # Check the model for multicollinearity

     vif(stepforwardOut)

    \begin{frame}[fragile]{Best Subsets Regression}
      \fontsize{8}{8}\selectfont
     Step only uses AIC criterion for comparing models. regsubsets is more flexible about criteria and calculates all possible subsets. 

     <<>>=
     
     regsubsets.out <- regsubsets(PhysiciansPer10000 ~ LandArea + PctRural 
                                  + MedianIncome + Population + PctUnder18 
                                  + PctOver65 + PctPoverty + PctUninsured
                                  + PctSomeCollege + PctUnemployed, data=mcounties)

     @

    \end{frame}


    \begin{frame}[fragile]{Best Subsets Regression}
    \fontsize{8}{8}\selectfont
     Step only uses AIC criterion for comparing models. regsubsets is more flexible about criteria and calculates all possible subsets. 
      
     <<>>=
     # Set the plot window up so you can examine the output side by side
     layout(matrix(1:2, ncol=2))
     #plot(regsubsets.out, scale="adjr2")  # use adjusted R^2
     #plot(regsubsets.out, scale="bic")    # use SBC

     # Don't forget to reset the plot window!
     layout(matrix(1:1, ncol=1))

    \begin{frame}[fragile]{Putting things together}
    \fontsize{8}{8}\selectfont
      \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Look at multiple statistics. They generally say similar things.
        \item Find the middle ground between an underspecified model and extraneous variables.
        \item Fine tune the model to get a correctly specified model - you may need to transform predictors and/or add interactions.
        \item Think about logical reasons why certain predictors might be useful, don't just focus on p-values.
      \end{itemize} 
    \end{frame}


    \begin{frame}[fragile]{Be careful of getting to crazy}
    \fontsize{8}{8}\selectfont
      \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item A general guideline is that you should not even consider more than one variable for every 10 to 15 cases in your dataset. 
        \item Otherwise, you can select the ones that happen to fit the data the best and essentially create a spurious correlation!
        \item Rember to check for multicolliearity and the LINE assumptions!
      \end{itemize}
